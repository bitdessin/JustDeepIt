Object Detection
================


Object detection combines classification and localization
to identify objects in an image and specify their locations through bounding boxes.
JustDeepIt supports multiple well-known deep neural network architectures,
such as Faster R-CNN\ [#fasterrcnn]_,
YOLOv3\ [#yolov3]_,
SSD\ [#ssd]_,
RetinaNet\ [#retinanet]_,
and FCOS\ [#fcos]_,
to build object detection models for training and inference.
The inference results can be stored as
images with bounding boxes or a JSON file in the COCO format.
The following image is an example of wheat head detection results
with Faster R-CNN using GWHD datasset\ [#gwhd]_.

GUI
===

The GUI window for object detection consists of three tabs:
**Preferences**, **Training**, and **Inference**.
These tabs are used for setting common parameters,
training models,
and inference (i.e., detecting objects) from the test
images using the trained model, respectively.
Tabs **Training** and **Inference** are disabled
until the settings in tab **Preferences** are defined.



Preferences
-----------

Tab **Preferences** is used for setting common parameters,
such as the architecture of detection model,
number of CPUs and GPUs to be used,
and the location (i.e., directory path) to a workspace
which is used to save intermediate and final results.
The required fields are highlighted with orange borders.
Detailed descriptions of the arguments are provided in the following table.

CUI
===


JustDeepIt implements three simple methods,
:meth:`train <justdeepit.models.OD.train>`,
:meth:`save <justdeepit.models.OD.save>`,
and :meth:`inference <justdeepit.models.OD.inference>`.
:meth:`train <justdeepit.models.OD.train>` is used for training the models,
while :meth:`save <justdeepit.models.OD.save>` is used for saving the trained weight,
and :meth:`inference <justdeepit.models.OD.inference>` is used for detecting objects in test images.
Detailed descriptions of these functions are provided below.


Architectures
-------------

A neural network architecture for object detection
can be initialized with class :class:`justdeepit.models.OD <justdeepit.models.OD>`.
For example, Faster R-CNN can be initialized by executing the following code.


.. code-block:: py

    from justdeepit.models import OD

    model = OD('./class_label.txt', model_arch='fasterrcnn')


To initialize Faster R-CNN with the pre-trained weight
(e.g. the weight pre-trained with COCO dataset),
the argument ``model_weight`` can be used.
Note that, the weight file (:file:`.pth`) pre-trained with COCO dataset
can be downloaded from the GitHub repositories of
`MMDetection <https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/master/configs>`_
or `Detectron2 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/tree/main/configs>`_.


.. code-block:: py

    from justdeepit.models import OD

    weight_fpath = '/path/to/pretrained_weight.pth'
    model = OD('./class_label.txt', model_arch='fasterrcnn', model_weight=weight_fpath)






Training
--------

Method :meth:`train <justdeepit.models.OD.train>` is used for the model training
and requires at least two arguments
to specify a folder containing the training images and annotations.
Annotations can be specified in a single file in the COCO format
or a folder containing multiple files in the Pascal VOC format.
Refer to the API documentation of :meth:`train <justdeepit.models.OD.train>`
for detailed usage.


Training a model with annotation in COCO format.


.. code-block:: py

    from justdeepit.models import OD
    
    train_images_dpath = '/path/to/folder/images'
    annotation_coco = '/path/to/coco/annotation.json'

    model = OD('./class_label.txt', model_arch='fasterrcnn')
    model.train(train_images_dpath, annotation_coco)
    

Training a model with annotation in Pascal VOC (xml) format.


.. code-block:: py
    
    from justdeepit.models import OD
    
    train_images_dpath = '/path/to/folder/images'
    annotation_voc = '/path/to/folder/voc'

    model = OD('./class_label.txt', model_arch='fasterrcnn')
    model.train(train_images_dpath, annotation_voc, 'pascalvoc')
    


The trained weight can be saved using method :meth:`save <justdeepit.models.OD.save>`,
which simultaneously stores the trained weight (:file:`.pth`)
and model configuration file (:file:`.py`).
Refer to the API documentation of :meth:`save <justdeepit.models.OD.save>`
for detailed usage.


.. code-block:: py

    model.save('trained_weight.pth')





Inference
---------

Method :meth:`inference <justdeepit.models.OD.inference>`
is used to detect objects in the test images using the trained model.
This method requires at least one argument to specify a single image,
list of images, or a folder containing multiple images.
The detection results are returned as
a class object of :class:`justdeepit.utils.ImageAnnotations <justdeepit.utils.ImageAnnotations>`.

To save the results in the COCO format,
we can use method :meth:`format <justdeepit.utils.ImageAnnotations.format>`
implemented in class :class:`justdeepit.utils.ImageAnnotations <justdeepit.utils.ImageAnnotations>`
to generate a JSON file in the COCO format.



.. code-block:: py

    from justdeepit.models import OD

    test_images = ['sample1.jpg', 'sample2.jpg', 'sample3.jpg']

    model = OD('./class_label.txt', model_arch='fasterrcnn', model_weight='trained_weight.pth')
    outputs = model.inference(test_images)

    outputs.format('coco', './predicted_outputs.coco.json')




To save the detection results as images, for example,
showing the detected bounding boxes on the images, method :meth:`draw <justdeepit.utils.ImageAnnotation.draw>`
implemented in class :class:`justdeepit.utils.ImageAnnotation <justdeepit.utils.ImageAnnotation>` can be used.



.. code-block:: py
    
    for output in outputs:
        output.draw('bbox', os.path.join('./predicted_outputs', os.path.basename(output.image_path)))


Refer to the corresponding API documentation of
:meth:`inference <justdeepit.models.OD.inference>`,
:meth:`format <justdeepit.utils.ImageAnnotations.format>`, and
:meth:`draw <justdeepit.utils.ImageAnnotation.draw>`,
for the detailed usage.
