Image analysis based on deep learning
are becoming mainstream and increasingly accessible
for solving various scientific problems in diverse fields including plant science.
Practical applications in plant science include
species classification,
fruit detection,
plant disease and pest detection,
weed detection,
leaf segmentation,
and plant segmentation.
Python programming language ant its libraries including
`PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_,
`MMDetection <https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/>`_,
and `Detectron2 <https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/>`_
have made deep learning much easier and more accessible to researchers.
However, deep learning technologies remain challenging
for programming beginners
because they require computer programming skills 
and a basic familiarity with character user interfaces (CUI).
JustDeepIt aims to
(i) simplify object detection and instance segmentation using deep learning
and (ii) faciliate collaborative researches between experimental and informatics researchers,
by providing both CUI and graphical user interface (GUI).
It may be applicable for image analysis in various disciplines beyond plant science.
